   - Ensures secure data handling and storage.
   - Regularly backs up data to prevent loss.

 Development Steps

1. *Requirement Analysis*:
   - Gather requirements from stakeholders (administration, finance department, students).
   - Define the scope and objectives of the project.

2. *System Design*:
   - Design the system architecture.
   - Develop database schemas for storing student and fee data.
   - Create wireframes and user interface designs.

3. *Technology Stack Selection*:
   - Choose appropriate technologies (programming languages, frameworks, databases) based on project needs.
   - Common choices include languages like Java, Python, PHP, and databases like MySQL or PostgreSQL.

4. *Development*:
   - Implement the front-end using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and a framework like React or Angular.
   - Develop the back-end using a server-side language (e.g., Node.js, Django, Laravel).
   - Integrate the database and ensure secure data transactions.

5. *Testing*:
   - Perform unit testing to ensure each module functions correctly.
   - Conduct integration testing to verify the system works as a whole.
   - User acceptance testing (UAT) with stakeholders to ensure the system meets requirements.

6. *Deployment*:
   - Deploy the system on a web server or cloud platform.
   - Configure the domain and set up security certificates.

7. *Maintenance and Support*:
   - Provide ongoing support for bug fixes and feature enhancements.
